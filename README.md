**Identify** and **explain** common and important components and concepts of web development markup languages
Markup language refers to a set of rules that determines the presentation and layout of text and images in a digital document. A markup language defines how digital documents will be structured through specific formats and elements presented on web pages. There are various examples of markup languages, including HTML, XML, and SGML, among others (Dinh and Wang 2020). Common components of markup languages include tags, header and body, lists, comments and paragraphs, and links, among others. Tags include specific words or characters used to annotate texts and format them in markup language. There are opening and closing tags, which mark the beginning and end of a comment or paragraph. The <header> section entails information such as the title of the document, while the <body> involves content and information displayed. The comments and paragraph sections entail notes displayed in the code but not in the browser. 

## #2 
**Define** the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:
 - packets: refers to small segments of data that are transmitted over a network. Packets contain various data, including payload, source IP address, and destination IP address, among others. Packets facilitate the data transmission process by dividing large data into segments that are manageable and enhance error detection. Packets enable data to arrive at their destination using different routes.

 - IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6): )- IP addresses refer to a unique address that helps identify a device in a local or internet network. IPv4 utilizes 32-bit numbers that include the network prefix and host number (Ashraf et al. 2020). For example, 99.48.227.227. On the other hand, IPv6 utilizes 128-bit numbers divided into eight groups, 16 bits each (Ashraf et al. 2020). For example, 2001:0000:130F:0000:0000:09C0:876A:130B. IP addresses facilitate communication through the identification of devices in a local or internet network. IPv6 improves on IPv4 by enhancing the scalability of the network. 
 - routers and routing: Routers refer to devices that facilitate the connection of multiple subnetworks or packet-switched networks. On the other hand, routing entails the path selected to forward IP packets towards their destination. Routers help control traffic between subnetworks by transferring data packets to specific IP addresses. Additionally, routers enable multiple devices to share an internet connection, which enhances communication.

 - domains and DNS: The domain name system (DNS) translates human-readable domain names into numerical IP addresses. A domain name refers to a unique name used to remember a website address, and it is simpler than IP addresses. An example of a domain name is 'google.com,' which helps access the Google website. DNS is essential in facilitating simplified navigation on the internet by users through the use of simple and easy-to-remember names rather than complex numerical IP addresses. Thus, DNS promotes usability and enhances the accessibility of the internet and websites.


**Explain** how each technology has contributed to the development of the internet.

## #3 
**Define** the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:
 - TCP: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) refers to a communication standard that allows computing devices and application programs to facilitate the transfer of messages in a specific network. TCP is designed to be used to send packets and deliver messages and data across an internet network. TCP establishes a reliable internet connection between two devices, which is essential for data transmission and data integrity. TCP is applicable to emails and web browsing where data delivery is consistently needed. 

 - HTTP and HTTPS: The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the base for the World Wide Web, and it utilizes hypertext links to load webpages. HTTP is a technology used to power network communication (Kerschbaumer et al. 2021). The HTTP's client-server architecture employs a request-response model, which regulates the communication between the client and the server. On the other hand, HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) refers to a secure version of HTTP, and it facilitates data transfer between a website and a web browser (Kerschbaumer et al. 2021). HTTPS has authentication and encryption features that regulate data privacy and data protection. HTTPS enhances internet security, which is essential for crucial services such as e-commerce and online banking.

 - web browsers (requests, rendering and developer tools): refer to software applications that facilitate information access on the World Wide Web (Kerschbaumer et al. 2021). A user requests specific information through the web browser, which in return gathers data from the web servers, which the client can view on their screen. A web browser has several features, including a refresh button, a back and forward button, and a home button. A refresh button is used to reload a page, while a home button returns the user to the home page. A web browser supports extensions, which optimizes the user experience. A web browser is essential for information access and development of web applications.


**Explain** how each technology has contributed to the development of client and server communication over the internet (50 - 150 words for each technology)

## #4 
**Describe** the features of interpreters and compilers and how they are different.
An interpreter is used during execution to read and translate code line by line, which makes it easier to detect and highlight errors. Therefore, interpreters decode one program line after another into machine code. However, interpreters have the potential to make the program run slower. With interpreters, the code is independent. On the other hand, a compiler refers to software that utilizes high-level programming code, which is translated instructions readable by a machine. Thus, a compiler decodes the entire source code into machine-readable code before execution. As a result, the execution runs faster as compared to the case of the interpreter because no translation is required during the process. Compilers have various features, including compilation speed, good error detection, and machine code speed, among others.


## #5 
**Identify** TWO commonly used programming languages and explain the benefits and drawbacks of each.

- Python- is a programming language used to analyze data, automate tasks, and build websites. Python simplifies code modification and maintenance because of its simplicity and clean syntax. Python also enhances readability and simplifies programming tasks. Other benefits of Python include easy documentation and implementation, a secure framework, code reusability, and open source. However, Python is less secure, slower than compiled languages, dynamically typed, and poor multithreading.

- JavaScript- is a dynamic programming language used for web applications, web development, and game development, among others. JavaScript enables a programmer to utilize complex features on web pages and monitor dynamic website content. JavaScript has various advantages, including regular updates, minimal server load, asynchronous, and speed and simplicity. However, JavaScript has various limitations, including debugging issues, code visibility, SEO challenges, and slower DOM.

Think back to a scenario or situation in your own software development projects or work.
Explain how you would do things differently if you had a chance to go through that scenario again, using an appropriate reflective cycle or reflection technique.

Looking at a development project on a web application I was handling, Gibbs' Reflective Cycle can help me reflect and determine what I would do differently. 
Description- A while ago, I was developing a web application, and I forgot to include unit tests at the beginning. 
Feelings- When I discovered bugs a long way into the development, I was frustrated by the mistake, and I almost abandoned the project. 
Evaluation- Due to the lack of unit tests in the initial stages, the debugging process became longer and more tedious.
Analysis- The lack of unit testing in the initial stages caused a lot of delays in the development process, and more efforts were required to handle the project.
Conclusion- Unit tests were an integral part of the project from the beginning because they would have helped identify the bugging problem early on. As a result, the debugging process would have started sooner, making it manageable and less tedious. Additionally, having a contingency plan would have helped me manage the problem better than I did.
Action Plan: I would ensure I have a contingency plan to help me through challenges. I would carry on with frequent check-ins to ensure the program is running as expected. More importantly, I would ensure that all the required measures are followed from the initial phase.

## #10
Explain the legal and ethical impacts of the usage of language-learning model technologies (such as ChatGPT) in written and technical works, such as reports and software projects.

Legal Impacts- Using language-learning models, such as ChatGPT, raises legal concerns on Intellectual Property (IP) because it is unclear who owns the written work or code generated from the model (Woithe and Filipec 2023). As a result, it is unclear if the intellectual rights belong to the AI or the individual who requested the information. Additionally, replication of existing information can result in cases of plagiarism. Other legal concerns related to using ChatGPT are data protection, compliance, and liability. As a result, it is unclear who is liable for flawed decisions. 
Ethical Impacts- Using ChatGPT has multiple ethical concerns, including data privacy, bias and fairness, and transparency and accountability. Using ChatGPT to process sensitive information can lead to a breach of data security and privacy. There are concerns about privacy and confidentiality regulations. Since humans initially developed the algorithm used in ChatGPT, there have been concerns about amplified biases during data training (Almarzouqi et al. 2024). As a result, ChatGPT will provide discriminatory and biased solutions. The use of an inclusive algorithm can help minimize bias and unfairness in the information provided by the model. Ethical AI is used to deal with algorithm bias in such technologies. Lastly, there are ethical concerns about transparency and accountability in the information generated. Regular monitoring can help ensure ChatGPT is adhering to set guidelines on accountability.
